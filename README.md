# Humans vs Zombies Final
A Unity project focused on implementing wandering, seeking and evading methods. Humans will flee or evade the closest Zombie within a certain radius. Zombies will seek or pursue the closest human. Zombies will wander when all humans are caught, and humans will wander if they are not close to any zombies. 

The program allows for the user to manipulate the speed of the zombies, human, or reset the simulation.

Pressing the "D" key will enable debug lines. 

All agents will avoid walls and obstacles.
